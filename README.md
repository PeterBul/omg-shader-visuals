# OMG Shader Visuals

This is mostly just test drawings with shaders and p5. The official drawing is shader-snake.

## How to run

In order to run the project, just install live server in vs code or use whatever other way you want to run the html and js.

Imports to the sketches are done through script import tags in the index.html files. This allows them to easily be uploaded to p5 online if wanted.
The package.json is just to install types for use when developing. They are used in the JSDocs strings.
